# FFT-Audio-Visualizer
A real-time audio visualizer that applies the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to display the frequency spectrum of .wav audio files through animated, color-coded bar charts. This project demonstrates how linear algebra and signal processing concepts translate into interactive visual computation.
